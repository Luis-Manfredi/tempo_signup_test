# tempo_signup_test
This repository contains a Node.js/Express.js project that allows an user to send a form with a post method to the server. Work in progress. The main goal is to make a functional auth application. 

Must have Node.js and EJS installed.

Installing Express modules:

Open your terminal then navigate to your file directory where you want to work with this project and run the command line: npm install express

Example: C:/Users/User/Desktop/YourFolder/Tempo_signup_test> npm install express


To install EJS:

Execute the command line: npm install ejs or npm i ejs

Example: C:/Users/User/Desktop/YourFolder/Tempo_signup_test> npm install ejs


PD:
At the moment, I have not applied database integration. I used an array called "users" to storage data received from the request body just for testing purposes.
